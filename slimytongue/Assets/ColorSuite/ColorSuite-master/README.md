ColorSuite
==========

![Screenshot 1][Screen1]

*ColorSuite* is a multifunctional color adjustment plugin for Unity, which
manages multiple color adjustment tasks in the single component. These tasks
are implemented in the single pass shader, and it automatically strips out
unused functions from the shader to keep the best performance.

Features
--------

- Tone mapping ([John Hable's filmic tone mapping operator][Hable])
- White balance adjustment (color temperature and green-magenta tint)
- Color saturation adjustment
- Tone curves (individual RGB channels and RGB-combined)
- Dithering (ordered dither or triangular PDF dither)

Usage Note
----------

#### HDR rendering and linear lighting

Although the ColorSuite shader is designed to work for any configuration,
it's specially optimized for the combination of HDR rendering and linear
lighting. It's recommended to use with these options.

#### Use dithering if banding

Dithering is used to avoid color banding, which occurs only with very low
contrast gradients (see the example below). In other words, it should be
turned off if no banding is present.
