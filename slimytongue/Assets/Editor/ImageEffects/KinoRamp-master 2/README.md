It generates a simple color gradient and blends it to the destination buffer.
It supports several blend modes (multiply, screen, overlay, hardlight and
softlight) and automatic color-space conversion -- it converts colors into
sRGB before blending to get a proper result that is equivalent to the common
photo-editing software like Photoshop.

System Requirements
